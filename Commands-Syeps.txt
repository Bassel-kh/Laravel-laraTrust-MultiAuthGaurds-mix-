    Installation
    1- You can install the package using composer:

        $ composer require santigarcor/laratrust

    2- Publish all the configuration files:

        $ php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laratrust"

        [WARNING]
            If this command did not publish any files, chances are, the Laratrust service provider hasn't been registered.
            Try clearing your configuration cache

                $ php artisan config:clear

    3- Run the setup command:

            Before running the command go to your config/laratrust.php file and change the values according to your needs.
