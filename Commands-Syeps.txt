Install Laratrust
    https://laratrust.santigarcor.me/docs/6.x/

    Installation
    1- You can install the package using composer:

        $ composer require santigarcor/laratrust

    2- Publish all the configuration files:

        $ php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laratrust"

        [WARNING]
            If this command did not publish any files, chances are, the Laratrust service provider hasn't been registered.
            Try clearing your configuration cache

                $ php artisan config:clear

    3- Run the setup command:
        [IMPORTANT]
            Before running the command go to your config/laratrust.php file and change the values according to your needs.

        $ php artisan laratrust:setup

        This command will generate the migrations, create the Role and Permission models (if you are using the teams feature it will also create a Team model)
        and will add the trait to the configured user models.

         Output: {

                Creating migration
                Migration created successfully.


                Creating Role model
                Role model created successfully.

                Creating Permission model
                Permission model created successfully.

                Adding LaratrustUserTrait to User model
                LaratrustUserTrait added successfully to App\User

         }

    ######################
    4- Dump the autoloader:
         $ composer dump-autoload

    5- Run the migrations:
         $ php artisan migrate

    IMPORTANT

    If you did the steps above you are done with the configuration,
    if not, please read and follow the whole configuration process
    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
        Migrations
        The migration will create five (or six if you use teams feature) tables in your database:

        roles — stores role records.
        permissions — stores permission records.
        teams — stores teams records (Only if you use the teams feature).
        role_user — stores polymorphic relations between roles and users.
        permission_role — stores many-to-many relations between roles and permissions.
        permission_user — stores polymorphic relations between users and permissions.

        ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
        Teams Feature
        NOTE

        The teams feature is optional, this part covers how to configure it after the installation.

        If you had your teams.enabled value set to true during the installation and automatic setup, you can skip this part.

        Set the teams.enabled value to true in your config/laratrust.php file.

        Run:

            $ php artisan laratrust:setup-teams
        Run:

            $ php artisan migrate

        Now you can use the teams feature in you code.

        Please refer to the teams concepts concepts to learn how to use them.

***** Some Info
        //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
            Role
                <?php

                namespace App;

                use Laratrust\Models\LaratrustRole;

                class Role extends LaratrustRole
                {
                }

            The Role model has three main attributes:

            name — Unique name for the Role, used for looking up role information in the application layer. For example: "admin", "owner", "employee".
            display_name — Human readable name for the Role. Not necessarily unique and optional. For example: "User Administrator", "Project Owner", "Widget Co. Employee".
            description — A more detailed explanation of what the Role does. Also, optional.
            Both display_name and description are optional; their fields are nullable in the database.

        /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

                    Permission
                        <?php

                        namespace App;

                        use Laratrust\Models\LaratrustPermission;

                        class Permission extends LaratrustPermission
                        {
                        }
                    The Permission model has the same three attributes as the Role:
                        - name — Unique name for the permission, used for looking up permission information in the application layer. For example: "create-post", "edit-user", "post-payment", "mailing-list-subscribe".
                        - display_name — Human readable name for the permission. Not necessarily unique and optional. For example "Create Posts", "Edit Users", "Post Payments", "Subscribe to mailing list".
                        - description — A more detailed explanation of the Permission.
                    In general, it may be helpful to think of the last two attributes in the form of a sentence: "The permission display_name allows a user to description."

                /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

                    Team

                            {
                            }
                    The Team model has three main attributes:
                        - name — Unique name for the Team, used for looking up team information in the application layer. For example: "my-team", "my-company".
                        - display_name — Human readable name for the Team. Not necessarily unique and optional. For example: "My Team", "My Company".
                        - description — A more detailed explanation of what the Team does. Also, optional.
                    Both display_name and description are optional; their fields are nullable in the database.

                            }
                        This class uses the LaratrustUserTrait to enable the relationships with Role and Permission.
                            It also adds the following methods roles(), hasRole($name), hasPermission($permission),
                                isAbleTo($permission), ability($roles, $permissions, $options), and rolesTeams() to the model.

#4 ----------------------------
Seeder
    Laratrust comes with a database seeder, this seeder helps you fill the permissions for each role
    depending on the module, and creates one user for each role.

    [NOTE]

        The seeder is going to work with the first user model inside the user_models array.
        The seeder doesn't support teams.

    1- To generate the seeder you have to run:

            $ php artisan laratrust:seeder
            and
            $ composer dump-autoload
            ------------------------
            ########################

    2- In the database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php file you have to add this to the run method:

           $this->call(LaratrustSeeder::class);

       [NOTE]
            If you have not run php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laratrust"
            you should run it in order to customize the roles, modules and permissions in each case.

            ////////////////// Begin Info /////////////////////
            Your config/laratrust_seeder.php file looks like this by default:

            return [
                ...
                'roles_structure' => [
                    'superadministrator' => [
                        'users' => 'c,r,u,d',
                        'payments' => 'c,r,u,d',
                        'profile' => 'r,u'
                    ],
                    'administrator' => [
                        'users' => 'c,r,u,d',
                        'profile' => 'r,u'
                    ],
                    'user' => [
                        'profile' => 'r,u',
                    ],
                    'role_name' => [
                        'module_1_name' => 'c,r,u,d',
                    ]
                ],
                'permissions_map' => [
                    'c' => 'create',
                    'r' => 'read',
                    'u' => 'update',
                    'd' => 'delete'
                ],
                ...
            ];

            To understand the role_structure you must know:

            The first level represents the roles.
            The second level represents the modules.
            The second level assignments are the permissions.
            With that in mind, you should arrange your roles, modules and permissions like this:

            return [
                'role_structure' => [
                    'role' => [
                        'module' => 'permissions',
                    ],
                ]
            ];
            #Permissions
            In case that you do not want to use the c,r,u,d permissions, you should change the permissions_map.

            For example:

            return [
                ...
                'roles_structure' => [
                    'role_name' => [
                        'module_1_name' => 'a,s,e,d',
                    ]
                ],
                'permissions_map' => [
                    'a' => 'add',
                    's' => 'show',
                    'e' => 'edit',
                    'd' => 'destroy'
                ],
                ...
            ];
            ////////////////// End Info /////////////////////
    3-
            $ php artisan db:seed

    4- to seed user
            create_users value on the laratrust_seeder config file to true

                $ php artisan db:seed
#5 ---------------------------
Administration Panel
    Laratrust comes with a simple administration panel for roles, permissions and their assignment to the users.

    Currently it supports:

        1- Permissions CRUD.
        2- Roles CRUD and permissions assignment.
        3- Assignment of roles and permission to the multiple users defined in user_models in the config/laratrust.php file.
        4- Restricting roles from being edited, deleted or removed.

        #How to use it
            1- Go to your config/laratrust.php file and change the panel.register value to true.
            2- Publish the assets used by the panel by running:
                    $ php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laratrust-assets --force

            By default the URL to access the panel is /laratrust.

            To customize the the URL and other available settings in the panel please
            go to the panel section in the config/laratrust.php file.
